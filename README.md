# Advent of Code 2023!


## First week!
I decided to do something fun this year!

I'm going to try to use a different programming language for each day of Advent
of Code 2023.

I might give up on that by day 7, but I will get through the first week at
first!

### Languages
- [x] Day 1: Go
- [x] Day 2: C#
- [x] Day 3: Java
- [x] Day 4: C
- [x] Day 5: Rust
- [x] Day 6: Typescript
- [x] Day 7: Python

# And it looks like I'll be doing it in Rust for the rest of AoC 2023!

## Why...?
Oh yay, my oxidization has overcome my drive to learn a new programming
language!

In all seriousness though, I find Rust really fun to write in. My friend (whose
name definitely hasn't popped up multiple times in the names of commits in this
repo) keeps bugging me about it being kind of slow to write in, but what he
doesn't understand is that I'm just doing this for fun, and I'm not trying to be
the leaderboard.

### Here's where I complain about my code quality

I like having solutions that are actually readable. I'm not going to claim that
my code is "self-documenting" or anything buzzword-ey like that, but my goal is
to be able to look back on it and understand what the hell I was thinking.

#### Speaking of, I'll have a day-by-day checkmark board for:
- Part 1
- Part 2
- Scripts
- Cleanup
- Comments
- Whatever other fun things I decide to do that day!
