# Advent of Code 2023!

I decided to do something fun this year!

I'm going to try to use a different programming language for each day of Advent
of Code 2023.

I might give up on that by day 7, but I will get through the first week at
first!

## Languages
- [ ] Day 1: [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [ ] Part 1
  - [ ] Part 2
- [ ] Day 2: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - [ ] Part 1
    - [ ] Part 2
